Thank you for your interest in testing Swiftfin!

The TestFlight instance of Swiftfin is used to test new features and fix bugs before being published to the App Store. It is always helpful to report bugs during this time and we are grateful for your time and resources. There are no expectations for how long work will be tested on TestFlight but we will work to publish to the App Store as soon as possible.
